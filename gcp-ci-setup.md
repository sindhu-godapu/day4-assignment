Step-by-Step Instructions
Create a New Branch:

Open your terminal or command line interface.
Navigate to your project's directory.
Use git commands to create and switch to a new branch named feature-gcp-ci.
Command: git checkout -b feature-gcp-ci
Add a New File and Document CI Setup:

Create a new file named gcp-ci-setup.md in your project directory.
Open the file in a text editor.
Document the steps required to set up a CI pipeline using CircleCI on GCP.
Include headings and subheadings to organize the content:
Introduction to CI on GCP using CircleCI
Setting Up CircleCI
Configuring Service Connections
Define Pipeline Stages:

Build Stage:
Under the Build section in gcp-ci-setup.md:
Describe how to configure the CircleCI build process.
Include details like specifying the configuration file (.circleci/config.yml), defining the build environment, project dependencies, required tools, and build commands.
Test Stage:
Under the Test section:
Detail how to run tests as part of the CI process.
Specify the testing framework, write the testing scripts, and configure test commands that need to be executed during the pipeline.
Deploy Stage:
Under the Deploy section:
Explain how to deploy the application to a Google Compute Engine instance.
Include steps to create and configure a Google Compute Engine (GCE) instance.
Outline deployment steps using SSH or any automated deployment tools (like gcloud CLI) within CircleCI.
Configure Build Triggers:

Document the process to set up build triggers in your gcp-ci-setup.md file.
Describe how to configure CircleCI to automatically start builds on code changes.
Include instructions on integrating CircleCI with your version control system (e.g., GitHub).
Explain how to enable automatic build triggers in the CircleCI configuration by setting up webhooks or utilizing git repository hooks.
Commit Your Changes:

Stage the changes you’ve made.
Command: git add gcp-ci-setup.md
Commit the changes with a clear message.
Command: git commit -m "Add documentation for CI pipeline setup with build, test, and deploy stages on GCP using CircleCI"
Push Your Changes and Create a Pull Request:

Push the feature-gcp-ci branch to the remote repository.
Command: git push origin feature-gcp-ci
Navigate to your repository hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Create a pull request to merge feature-gcp-ci into the main branch.
Provide a descriptive title and summary for the pull request explaining the changes and their purpose.
Optimized Solution Considerations:
Branch Name: Use a descriptive branch name for better project management.
Documentation: Ensure the documentation is clear and straightforward to follow to avoid confusion during CircleCI setup and execution.
Pipeline Configuration: Clearly define each pipeline stage to ensure smooth integration and delivery.
Automated Triggers: Setting up automatic build triggers ensures continuous integration and testing without manual intervention.
Commit Messages: Use descriptive commit messages for better version control and collaboration.
Following these steps ensures a well-organized approach to setting up a CI pipeline with CircleCI on GCP, adhering to best practices in software developStep-by-Step Instructions
