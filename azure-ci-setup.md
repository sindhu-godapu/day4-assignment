Step-by-Step Instructions
Create a New Branch:

Open your terminal or command line interface.
Navigate to your project's directory.
Use git commands to create and switch to a new branch named feature-azure-ci.
Command: git checkout -b feature-azure-ci
Add a New File and Document CI Setup:

Create a new file named azure-ci-setup.md in your project directory.
Open the file in a text editor.
Document the steps required to set up a CI pipeline using either GitLab CI or Azure DevOps on Azure.
Include headings and subheadings to organize the content:
Introduction to CI on Azure
Setting Up GitLab CI or Azure DevOps
Configuring Service Connections
Define Pipeline Stages:

Under the Build section in azure-ci-setup.md:
Describe how to configure the build process.
Include details like project dependencies, tools required, and build commands.
Under the Test section:
Detail how to run tests during the CI process.
Specify the testing framework, test commands, and necessary configurations.
Under the Deploy section:
Explain how to deploy the application to an Azure VM.
Describe steps to create and configure an Azure VM.
Outline deployment steps using either SSH for manual deployment or automated deployment using Azure DevOps pipelines or GitLab CI jobs.
Configure Build Triggers:

Document the process to set up build triggers in your azure-ci-setup.md file.
Explain how to configure the CI tool (GitLab CI or Azure DevOps) to automatically start builds on code changes.
Include details about setting up repository hooks or Webhooks if using GitHub or another repository service.
Provide instructions on enabling automatic build triggers in the pipeline configuration.
Commit Your Changes:

Stage the changes youâ€™ve made.
Command: git add azure-ci-setup.md
Commit the changes with a descriptive message.
Command: git commit -m "Add documentation for CI pipeline setup with build, test, and deploy stages"
Push Your Changes and Create a Pull Request:

Push the feature-azure-ci branch to the remote repository.
Command: git push origin feature-azure-ci
Navigate to your repository hosting service (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
Create a pull request to merge feature-azure-ci into the main branch.
Provide a descriptive title and summary for the pull request, explaining the changes and their purpose.
Optimized Solution Considerations:
Branch Name: Use a descriptive branch name for better project management.
Documentation: Ensure the documentation is clear and easy to follow to avoid confusion during CI setup and execution.
Pipeline Configuration: Clearly define each pipeline stage to ensure smooth integration and delivery.
Automated Triggers: Setting up automatic build triggers ensures continuous integration and testing without manual intervention.
Commit Messages: Use descriptive commit messages for better version control and collaboration.
Following these steps ensures a well-organized approach to setting up a CI pipeline with GitLab CI or Azure DevOps on Azure, adhering to best practices in software development.
